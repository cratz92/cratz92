... Passionate over technologies...  Eager to learn new stuff...
I have an MSc in mechanical engineer. After some time working in the area and with the start of Covid-19 pandemic, decided to pursue my other passion that is programing and drawing. I now attend a computer science course at the globally well-known 42 school. Since I want to continue to be financially independent, I have decided to start a company in the game development area. This way I can use all the knowledge that I know now and in the future with the art side. I hope that in the nearby future I can come here to sell some courses but for now, I will restrict to affiliations.
